# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...







      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...






      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### My answers:

#### Data Visualization 1: Bad Example
* https://i0.wp.com/www.codeconquest.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12.png?w=680&ssl=1

1. Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

This bar chart, broadcasted by Fox News, attempts to show the percentage of Americans identifying as Christians in 2009 versus 2019. It is classified as a bad example of data visualization for several reasons:

* Misleading Y-Axis: The y-axis starts at 58 instead of 0, exaggerating the decline in the Christian population. According to visualization best practices, such as those outlined by Edward Tufte in "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," bar charts should start their y-axis at zero to accurately represent the data. Deviating from this principle distorts the viewer's perception of the magnitude of change.

* Proportional Misrepresentation: The visual manipulation of the bars makes a 12% decline appear much larger. This visual distortion violates the principle of proportional ink, emphasized by Tufte, where the visual representation should be proportional to the actual data values.

* Rhetorical Choices: Referring to D'Ignazio and Klein's "Data Feminism," this visualization is a rhetorical object, reflecting choices about the selection and representation of reality. The chart's design choices intentionally mislead viewers, showing that visualizations are not neutral, even if they present factual data.

* Aesthetic, Substantive, and Perceptual Qualities: This visualization fails in all three aspects:
    * Aesthetic: The chart is not pleasing to look at due to its misleading proportions and lack of proper context.
    * Substantive: It does not accurately and honestly present the data, given the misleading y-axis.
    * Perceptual: It conveys a misleading message about the decline of Christians in the U.S., violating ethical standards of clear and truthful communication.

2. How could this data visualization have been improved?

* Correcting the Y-Axis: The y-axis should start at zero to provide a true representation of the data. This adjustment would prevent the exaggerated visual effect and present a more accurate picture of the 12% decline.

* Clearer Axis Labels and Titles: The chart should have clearer titles and labels to ensure viewers understand what is being presented. Including the actual data values on the bars can also help in making the chart more informative.

* Consistent Scaling: The scale of the y-axis should be consistent and based on the range of the data. Using a standard increment that makes the changes apparent without distortion would improve accuracy.

* Alternative Visualization: A line chart might be more effective in showing changes over time. This would allow viewers to see the trend over the decade without misinterpretation caused by improper scaling.


#### Data Visualization 2: Good Example
* https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/

1. Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

This visualization from Visual Capitalist effectively communicates the milestone of the world population reaching 8 billion. It is an excellent example of good data visualization due to several key attributes:

* Simplicity and Clarity: The visualization uses a straightforward circular design to represent Earth, which is intuitive and immediately recognizable. This aligns with principles discussed in Knaflic's "Storytelling with Data," where simplicity and clarity are essential for effective communication.

* Effective Use of Color: Colors are used strategically to differentiate continents and further break down populations by country. This visual differentiation helps in quickly conveying complex information in an understandable manner, following the guidelines set by authors like Few in "Information Dashboard Design."

* Accurate Representation: The visualization does not distort data; instead, it provides an accurate and proportional representation of the world's population distribution. This adherence to truthfulness in representation is crucial, as emphasized by Tufte and Knaflic.

* Engaging Design: The circular layout and use of lines to separate countries make the visualization visually appealing and engaging. According to Knaflic, engaging visualizations capture the audience's attention and make the information memorable.

* Rhetorical Object: Following D'Ignazio and Klein's discussion on rhetoric, this visualization is a rhetorical object that makes conscious choices to represent reality. While it is not neutral, it remains factual, fulfilling its purpose of effectively communicating the data.

* Aesthetic, Substantive, and Perceptual Qualities: This visualization excels in all three aspects:
    * Aesthetic: It is visually appealing and well-designed.
    * Substantive: It accurately and honestly presents the data.
    * Perceptual: It clearly conveys the message of global population distribution and growth.

2. How could this data visualization have been improved?

* Contextual Information: Including a brief context or annotation explaining the significance of the milestone and potential implications for resources, environment, and global policies would provide a deeper understanding of the visualization.

* Comparative Data: Adding historical data to show how the population has grown over time or projections for future growth could provide additional context and make the visualization even more informative.
