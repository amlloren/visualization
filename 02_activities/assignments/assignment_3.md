# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Your answer...



        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Your answer...



        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

# MY ANSWERS

### Data Visualization 1: Bad Example
* https://i0.wp.com/www.codeconquest.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12.png?w=680&ssl=1

1. Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable.

* Accessibility: This visualization is not accessible. Its misleading y-axis, which starts at 58 instead of 0, distorts the data, making it difficult for viewers to interpret accurately. Additionally, it lacks alt-text, which is essential for screen readers. According to D'Ignazio and Klein's "Data Feminism" and the Tactical Technology Collective (2013), accessibility is crucial for empowering all users, including those with disabilities, to understand and utilize data effectively.

* Reproducibility: The visualization lacks transparency about data sources and methods, making it difficult to reproduce. Reproducibility is vital for verifying the accuracy of a visualization, as discussed by Tufte, Knaflic, and Tactical Technology Collective (2013). Without clear documentation, others cannot recreate the visualization to verify its accuracy.

* Equity: The visualization is not equitable because it misleads viewers, potentially manipulating public opinion. Equitable visualizations should represent data truthfully and fairly, as emphasized by D'Ignazio and Klein and Tactical Technology Collective (2013). By exaggerating the decline in the Christian population, this visualization could disproportionately influence certain groups, thus lacking equity.

2. How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?

* Accessibility:
    * Alt-text: Add descriptive alt-text to convey the essential information. For example: "Bar chart showing the percentage of Americans identifying as Christians in 2009 (77%) and 2019 (65%). The y-axis starts at 58, misleadingly exaggerating the decline."
Correct the Y-Axis: Start the y-axis at 0 to provide a true representation of the data, making it easier for viewers to interpret accurately.
    
    * Reproducibility: Include detailed information about data sources, collection methods, and any transformations applied to the data. This transparency allows others to recreate and verify the visualization, as recommended by Tactical Technology Collective (2013).

* Equity: Ensure the visualization accurately represents the data without exaggeration or distortion. Adhere to ethical visualization practices, such as maintaining proportional scales and providing context. Tactical Technology Collective (2013) highlights the importance of fairness and neutrality in presenting data.

### Data Visualization 2: Good Example
* https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/

1. Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable.

* Accessibility: This visualization is highly accessible. Its use of simple, intuitive design elements like color-coded continents and a circular representation of Earth makes it easy to understand for a broad audience. D'Ignazio and Klein, as well as Tactical Technology Collective (2013), emphasize the importance of accessibility in data visualizations. However, it could benefit from alt-text to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments.

* Reproducibility: The visualization is likely reproducible, assuming the data sources are publicly available and clearly documented. By providing detailed information on the data sources and methods used, others can recreate the visualization. This adheres to the principles of transparency and reproducibility discussed by Tufte, Knaflic, and Tactical Technology Collective (2013).

* Equity: This visualization is equitable as it accurately represents the world's population without distortion. D'Ignazio and Klein emphasize fairness and truthful representation in data visualizations. This visualization achieves equity by presenting the data accurately and respecting the complexity of global demographics, aligning with the principles outlined by Tactical Technology Collective (2013).

2. How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?

* Accessibility:

    * Alt-text: Add descriptive alt-text to ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments. For example: "Circular visualization representing the world's population at 8 billion as of November 15, 2022. Different colors represent continents and lines separate countries."

    * Interactive Elements: Adding interactive elements, such as tooltips with additional data details, could further enhance user engagement and understanding, as suggested by Tactical Technology Collective (2013).
Reproducibility: To ensure reproducibility, include clear citations of data sources and a description of the methodology used to process the data. Providing access to the raw data would also be beneficial, aligning with the guidelines from Tactical Technology Collective (2013) on transparency and documentation.

* Equity: The visualization could further improve equity by including contextual information about the implications of population growth. This could involve discussing resource distribution, environmental impact, and socio-economic challenges, ensuring the visualization not only informs but also educates viewers on the broader context. Tactical Technology Collective (2013) emphasizes the importance of providing context to help users understand the broader implications of the data.
